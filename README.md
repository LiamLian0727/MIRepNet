# Do BCIs Really Need One Generalized Model? RepMI: Toward Paradigm-Specific EEG Representations for Motor Imagery
We will release our code after accepted.

## Overview
We introduced RepMI, the first EEG foundation model specifically designed for MI paradigm. A high-quality EEG data pipeline was developed, featuring a neurophysiologically informed channel template that aligns heterogeneous EEG electrode layouts into a unified spatial framework. Furthermore, an efficient pretraining strategy combining self-supervised masked token reconstruction and supervised MI classification was proposed, enabling rapid adaptation to novel subjects and tasks via minimal downstream fine-tuning. Extensive evaluations on five downstream MI tasks encompassing 47 subjects demonstrated the efficacy and robustness of RepMI, consistently surpassing state-of-the-art specialized and generalized EEG models. Our results underscore the significant advantage and practical necessity of paradigm-specific EEG foundation modeling.
